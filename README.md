🏥 Healthcare Dataset Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a Healthcare Dataset to extract meaningful insights and visualize key patterns.
The goal is to understand relationships between patient health factors (like age, gender, medical conditions, treatment history, etc.) and outcomes such as recovery, readmission, or severity.

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains healthcare-related attributes such as:

Patient ID

Age

Gender

Blood Pressure / Sugar Levels

Medical Condition / Diagnosis

Treatment Type

Hospital Stay Duration

Recovery / Outcome Status

(Adjust columns based on your dataset)

🔍 Steps Performed

Data Loading – Read the dataset using pandas

Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates

Corrected data types

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics of key features

Patient distribution by age & gender

Common medical conditions

Treatment effectiveness

Data Visualization

Bar plots, Pie charts, and Histograms

Correlation Heatmaps

Line & Scatter plots for trend analysis

Insights

Example: Older patients have longer hospital stays

Example: Patients with higher sugar levels are more prone to readmission

Example: Certain treatments reduce recovery time significantly

📊 Key Insights

✔️ Patients with higher attendance/check-ups often show better recovery rates
✔️ Certain conditions (like high BP + diabetes) increase hospital stay duration
✔️ Female patients between 30–50 had higher readmission rates
✔️ Early diagnosis reduces severity levels

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Git & GitHub for version control
